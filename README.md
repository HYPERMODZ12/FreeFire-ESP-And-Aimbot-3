# Free Fire ESP And Aimbot 3
A customized LGL Android mod menu, containing Canvas ESP, aimbot, hooking, and patching codes for Free Fire Android

Project was been sent to me by brazilian modders, but I don't care about shitty Free Fire anymore, I will share here publicly

Mod menu is based on my old template

*This one is taken from a random Youtube video, didn't bother testing it. I can't confirm how it looks like... Let's just assume it look like this since this one has Canvas :))*
